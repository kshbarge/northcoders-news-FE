- NC news is a project showcasing a full stack of development technologies, by creating a news app with basic CRUD functionality. This repository contains the frontend data of the site, and uses React to create a navigable webpage. The hosted website is already populated with dummy data, so it is open to navigate around and interact with!

- The minimum version of node required to run this repo locally is v23.11.0.

- If you wish to run this project locally, make a fork of it and then use the command `git clone (your repo url)` in the location at which you wish to set up a local repository. From here, you can use `cd (repo name)` to navigate into the repository, and `code .` to open it in VScode if you have it downloaded.
